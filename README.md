## Background

The software "Geo Quantum" was developed during the master's degree in electrical engineering at the Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG) with the purpose of simulating electronic transport in nanodiodes when subjected to a potential difference between its terminals (anode and cathode) from the perspective of the quantum method.

The NEGF Model is considered in this modeling.

The implementation was done in the MATLAB 2022.

The objectives of this repository are:
1. Open-source implementation of the **NEGF model** foundations for electronic transport simulation in 2D;
2. Use of the **NEGF Method** for quantum particle simulation in a graphene medium;
3.
